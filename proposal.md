- 2 - At least one or two stages, all of which contains basic enemies that shoot and a boss enemy
- 3 - Player that can shoot bullets at enemies

- 5 - Proper font, artwork, sound effects

## Nice To Have
- 1 - Satisfactory level of polish / no obvious bugs
- 2 - Proper main menu screen
- 3 - Options, score menus
- 4 - Multiple difficulties
- 5 - More than 2 stages
- 6 - Proper 3D stage backgrounds
