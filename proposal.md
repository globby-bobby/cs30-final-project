# Project Proposal
I will make a 'bullet hell game' similar to the Touhou series of games 
I could try to remake one of the games, or do my own take on it (I will decide this later)

## Needs To Have
- 1 - Bullets that collide with the player
- 2 - More than one 'stage'
- 3 - Player that can shoot bullets at enemies
- 4 - Menu screen, results screen
- 5 - Proper font, artwork, sound effects

## Nice To Have
- 1 - Satisfactory level of polish
- 2 - 
- 3 - Extra things from Touhou games
- 4 - General story the game follows
- 5 - Extra difficulties
- 6 -
