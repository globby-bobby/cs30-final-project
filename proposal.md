# Project Proposal
I will make a bullet hell game similar to the Touhou series of games 
I will remake (or demake) the 'first' game, Touhou 6

## Needs To Have
- 1 - Bullets that collide with the player
- 2 - At least one or two stages, all of which contains basic enemies that shoot, a 'miniboss', more basic enemies, and a boss
- 3 - Player that can shoot bullets at enemies
- 4 - Menu screen, results screen
- 5 - Proper font, artwork, sound effects

## Nice To Have
- 1 - Satisfactory level of polish
- 2 - Dialogue between characters before fighting
- 3 - Proper main menu screens
- 4 - Options, score menus
- 5 - All four difficulties as opposed to one default one (they have different bullet patterns, I believe)
- 6 - More than 2 stages
- 7 - Proper 3D stage backgrounds
