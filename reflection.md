# Reflection.md
I enjoyed working on this but I feel I could have done much better if I was more motivated and gave myself more time to work on it.

## What would I do differently if I could do this again
I would be more realistic when it came to what I could do and I would just give myself more time to do it. I feel the code I wrote is good enough except for the last bits I added which I wrote lazily because I had other assignments to do

## Did I complete everything in the Needs to Have list?
No, I was very close though. I did everything except add a boss enemy and sound effects.

## Hardest part of the project
Probably what I did today, I've been writing code with a sore back for like three hours straight and I don't ever want to write code again. The actual most complex thing I did was probably thinking of how to get the stats in the text files to the stats for the enemies, and I think I did pretty good for not looking it up. That, and writing it too.

## Problems I couldn't solve
Except for the lack of time problem, I did everything I needed to. I can steer clear of things I don't understand because I think of how I implement things before considering them, so nothing mentioned wasn't delivered (at least because they weren't too challenging)
