//create enemy with a type, time to spawn, position, direction to turn every frame, and speed to move every frame
//program reads last four numbers when getting x and y, 0100 would equal 100 and -100 would equal -100, 100 would equal :100
//interval: how long enemy moves straight until can attack/despawn
//delay: frames between attacks
//lifetime: frames until enemy moves in straight line (to move offstage and despawn)
